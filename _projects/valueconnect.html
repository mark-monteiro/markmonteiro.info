<p>
    <a href='https://www.valueconnect.ca/' target='_blank'>Value Connect</a> is a property appraisal management company, harnessing technology
    to facilitate speedy turnaround times and build advanced, consistent reports.
</p>
<p>
    The project was generated and scaffolded using the <a href='https://jhipster.github.io/' target='_blank'>JHipster</a> Yeoman generator.
    The technology stack includes a back-end JSON API created with Java and Spring, and a front-end single page website written in AngularJS.
</p>
<p>
    Listed below are some notable features of the software and interesting development points:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Reports are built with a custom form-builder solution that supports partial completion. A custom
        server-side validation solution is also used and integrates with
        <a href='https://material.angularjs.org/latest/demo/input' target='_blank'>Angular Material</a> to dynamically display validation
        errors in the front-end. All submissions are versioned and each version can be viewed or reverted to at any time.
    </li>
    <li>
        The workflow for each report is managed by a pre-defined state machine, implemented using
        <a href='http://projects.spring.io/spring-statemachine/' target='blank'>Spring Statemachine</a>.
    </li>
    <li>
        Access to software is divided among many different security roles and managed by Spring Security. The site has passed a rigorous
        3rd party security audit provided by <a href='https://www.coalfire.com/' target='blank'>Coalfire</a>.
    </li>
    <li>
        Google Maps <a href='https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/geocoding/intro' target='blank'>Geocoding API</a> is used to
        automatically locate and verify user submitted addresses. It is also used to auto-populate city, provice and postal code fields on
        user forms.
    </li>
    <li>
        Google Maps <a href='https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/distance-matrix/' target='blank'>Distance Matrix API</a> is
        used to automatically calculate distances between locations.
    </li>
    <li>
        Google Maps <a href='https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/static-maps/' target='blank'>Static Maps API</a> is used to
        automatically generate maps that are used in the final report.
    </li>
    <li>
        Multiple languages are supported using <a href='https://angular-translate.github.io/' target='_blank'>Angular Translate</a>.
    </li>
