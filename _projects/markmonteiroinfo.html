<p>
  This website is built with Jekyll, a static website generator. They layout and styling for the site were branched off
  of a free base theme from <a href="http://startbootstrap.com/template-overviews/freelancer/">startbootstrap.com</a>
  and modified appropriately. A notable modification is the incorporation and modification of a vertical timeline
  from <a href="http://codyhouse.co/gem/vertical-timeline/">codyhouse.co</a>.
</p>
<p>
  The site is hosted using Netlify, which provides simple, free hosting for static websites using the Jekyll web
  framework. The collection and templating features of Jekyll are used to abstract the rendering of each project in the
  portfolio section.
</p>
<p>
  The site also integrates several CI/CD components. New code changes are integrated using GitHub pull requests which
  automatically runs tests on TravisCI, builds a deployment preview with Netlify, and analyzes code quality with
  CodeClimate. When all checks have passed the branch is safe to merge into master at which point a new build is
  automatically triggered and deployed live with Netlify.
