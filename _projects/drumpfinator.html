<p>
    This was a quick and simple project used as an opportunity to gain familiarity with
    the development of browser extensions. The application uses the native Javascript
    TreeWalker API to scan the DOM and replace the name of Donald Trump with colorful
    and dynamically generated names. The MutationObserver API is also used to monitor the DOM
    for changes and perform the same operations on dynamically added content.
