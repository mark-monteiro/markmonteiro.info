Senti Solutions is an engineering design company that focuses on unique phase
change, energy transfer and mass transfer applications. Prior to the
introduction of this position all machines were developed for manual operation
with a physical control panel interface. As the sole automation developer for
this company, I am responsible for integrating software automation capabilities
into these machines using programmable logic controllers and connected HMIs.

This integration starts with the architectural design of systems, taking into
account requirements to connect and communicate with multiple machines in order
to synchronize larger processing operations. In order to meet rigorous
industrial standards, all software requirements are exhaustively documented and
tested before, during and after implementation. The development of the HMIs also
involves wireframe UX design, which is later complimented with a more concrete
design from another designer.

As Senti is still a relatively small company with only one software developer,
there are also several other responsibilities that have evolved with this role.
I have also taken on the responsibility of advising on digital policy and
security for the company, as well as quickly developing small, static websites
as needed.
