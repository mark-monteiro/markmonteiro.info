    This project was a special challenge because it was necessary to include as many accessibility features as possible
    so that it could be navigated and used by users with various visual and auditory impairments. This was done with a
    React-based application to provide a fast, fluid, and dynamic interface, without compromising accessibility. Before
    launch, the site was demoed with several test groups with visual and auditory impairments and was received well.
